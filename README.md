# MonoDevelop.Debugger.Soft.Unity
Soft Unity debugger client for MonoDevelop 6.X

This branch is specifically for MonoDevelop 6.X, and _may or may not_ work with Xamarin Studio.

# Configuration
Before running `build-mpacks.sh`, edit `build-mpacks.sh` to ensure that `MDTOOL_PATH` points to the `bin/mdtool.exe` file inside your MonoDevelop installation folder.
